# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur when manipulating the DOM in JavaScript. The error arises when attempting to access or modify a DOM element *after* it has been removed from the DOM tree.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page with a `div` and a button.  The JavaScript function `myFunction` removes the `div` element, then attempts to add content back to it. This results in an error because the element no longer exists in the DOM.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code.  To avoid this error, always check if an element exists before trying to manipulate it or use proper DOM manipulation techniques that avoid creating errors, such as utilizing DOM manipulation functions like insertAdjacentHTML.
